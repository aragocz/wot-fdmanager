# What is this ?
WoT FDManager is a tiny project I did for a relative, since downloading the mod manually every time an updated rolled around was a pain, it's a simple tool that does the work for me, feel free to use it, but it's quickly put together. I hold no responsibility for any harm this program may cause.
You've been warned.

# SETUP
1. Download the executable (obviously)
2. In the same folder as the executable, create folder `mod` and `modextracted` and a file `.env`
3. Into the `.env` type the following `wotPath="PATH"` where `PATH` is replaced by the root folder of WoT example would be `wotPath="C:\Users\aragocz\AppData\Local\Wargaming.net\Worldoftanks\"`, if you don't know the path, you can access it via the launcher
4. Download the newest version of the [mod](https://www.frost-zone.eu/fdmod/) and insert it into the `mod` folder
5. Launch the executable
6. Open WoT and the mod should be there
